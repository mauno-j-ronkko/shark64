# Building the project

The home screen of the sharkC64 IDE looks as follows:
![Selecting active module](../images/building.png)

To build the project, click the Build action in the Project section.
It will first compile the project and then write the executable prg file.

A dialog is shown to confirm a successful build.
If errors are found during the compilation, the editor view will be opened
and the first error location will be displayed. For more about the
editor view, see the documentation about [editing](editing.md).
