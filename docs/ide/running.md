# Running the active module

The home screen of the sharkC64 IDE looks as follows (captured on version 0.3):
![Selecting active module](../images/running.png)

To run the active module, click the Run action in the Module section.
If the module has not been built yet, the Run action will first build it
and then run it. 

The Run action uses the Runner command to run the built prg file.
If the Runner command is not supplied, the Run action is not active. 
To read more about the Runner command, see the text about the [runner](setting-runner.md)
action.

If errors are found during the building phase, the editor view will be opened
and the first error location will be displayed. For more about the
editor view, see the documentation about [editing](editing.md).
