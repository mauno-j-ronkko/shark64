# Setup

To set up your working environment to run _sharkC64_, you'll need Java Runtime
environment (or development kit) and VICE emulator.
Java environment is needed to run the _sharkC64_ compiler.
VICE emulator is needed to run the compiled program.
For compatibility, it is recommended that you install the latest version
of the Java environment. For instance, Java Temurin-17 JDK is used for the development of
_sharkC64_. 


1. To install the latest version of Java Temurin JDK [^1], 
   you can follow the instructions from the official website [^2].

2. To install the VICE emulator from the official website [^3], 
   follow the instructions from the download page [^4]. 
   There is also a user manual for VICE [^5].
