# Installing

Before installing the sharkC64 IDE, check that you have installed compatible Java Runtime
environment (or development kit) and VICE emulator, see [setup](setup.md).

Steps to install the latest version of the sharkC64 IDE:
1. Open the release page [here](https://github.com/mauno-j-ronkko/sharkC64/releases).
2. Click the "Assets" option on the latest release. It will open a list of assets,
   including a zip file named "sharkC64-x.y.z.zip", where "x.y.z" is the latest version.
3. Click the zip file "sharkC64-x.y.z.zip", and it will start the downloading immediately. 
   Your browser will indicate where the zip file has been downloaded.
4. Unzip the zip file to any folder, where you would like to run the sharkC64 IDE,
   for instance, I have unzipped it on my Windows computer to folder `C:\SHARKC64`
5. Verify that the zip file has been successfully unzipped. 
   The folder structure should be as follows:
   ```
   C:\SHARKC64
