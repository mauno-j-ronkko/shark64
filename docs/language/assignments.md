# Assignment statements

Assignment statement computes the value of an expression and stores it to
the given variable.
```
corner := (char + attributes) and bitFilter 
```

In an assignment statement, the type of the variable must match with the 
result type of the expression. In other words, if the expression returns
a result value of type `byte`, the variable must also be of type `byte`.
