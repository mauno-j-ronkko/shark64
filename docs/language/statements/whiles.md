# While statements

A while statement repeatedly executes a statement block, as long as a given expression evaluates to `true`.
The while statement is of the following form.
```
while a<b do
   a := a + 1
end 
```

In the while statement, the expression after the `while` keyword must evaluate to a boolean value.
The expression is then followed by the `do` keyword that indicates the start of the statement block.
The statement block ends with the keyword `end`.
The statement block is executed repeatedly, as long as the expression evaluates to `true`.

The statement block may have multiple statements. 
It can consist of any statements, including if statements and nested while statements. 
Each nested while statement must end with the `end` keyword.
