# Empty statement

An empty statement can be used to separate other statements in a single row.
As such, the empty statement does nothing. It does not even produce any byte code.
An empty statement is a semicolon, `;`.
Because of the nature of empty statements, their use is optional.

The following example shows two assignment statements separated by an empty statement.
```
   a := a + 1; b := 0
```
